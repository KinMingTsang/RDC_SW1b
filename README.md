As we want to use coordinate system to identify  the obsticle position, basket and current position, We are going to create a function call path planning and using Bezier Curve to plan a smoothest path and follows it.
In order to organize the programme better, we create some helper functions like Speed control and Writeposition function to control the speed and update the position of obsticle and current position respectively.
